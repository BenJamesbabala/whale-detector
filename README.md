# whale-detector

So this repository is my PyTorch solution for Kaggle whale-detection challenge! The objective of this challenge was to basically do a binary classification (hence really a detection), on the existance of whale signals in the water. 

A power spectrogram of a whale signal is shown below:

Similarly, the power spectrogram of a signal with no whale signal present is shown here:
